<h3> Our 1.1.9 project features multiple bugs, a watering can, and flowers to illustrate our knowledge of turtle. The spider, ladybug, and watering can are stationary. The bee moves back and forth across the top of the screen. To grow your garden, you can click anywhere on the screen and a flower will grow. </h3

<h2> Cross the Lake </h2>

<h3> In our 1.2.5 project, a racer tries to cross the lake full of turtles. The turtles move across the lake at various speeds. If the racer hits the turtle, the racer resets. Once the racer crossers the river, the game is over, and the top displays "Congrats! You made it across!" </h3>

<h3> Our 1.3.1 is an interactive story about a zombie apocalypse. As zombies appear, you have to make choices to try to survive, such as hiding in a house or running away. As the story progresses, you go on a supply run and have to make more choices that determine the outcome of the story. Your goal is to survive the night. </h3>
